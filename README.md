## Welcome to my Profile.
**`Still a Padawan of the Code`**

I am a student of Engineering and Computer Science, aspiring to enter the field of technology. I am passionate about technology, and my first contact with it was during high school through an introductory course at USP, where I discovered the world of Robotics.
        
Currently, I dedicate my time to studying backend and cybersecurity and wish to expand into mechanical studies. My current dream is to pursue a technical career. 
I have some hobbies; I really enjoy drawing and writing stories (quite far from the technology subject, isn't it?). I also like cooking and making different drinks. I love diving into the internet and learning random facts.
